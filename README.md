# RMS Adaptive Filter

This project demonstrates the implementation of an **RMS Adaptive Filter**. RMS adaptive filters are commonly used in signal processing to minimize error and adapt to time-varying systems. These filters automatically adjust their parameters based on the characteristics of the input signal.

## Problem Description

In many real-world applications, signals can be noisy or distorted due to external factors. An adaptive filter continuously adjusts its coefficients to minimize the error between the desired and actual output. RMS (Root Mean Square) adaptive filtering is a technique where the filter weights are adjusted based on the root mean square error of the signal.

## Filter Overview

An adaptive filter has two key components:
1. **Filter Weights (Coefficients)**: The filter applies these weights to the input signal to produce an output.
2. **Error Correction Mechanism**: Based on the error between the filter output and the desired signal, the weights are adjusted iteratively.

### RMS Adaptive Algorithm

The basic steps of the RMS adaptive filtering algorithm are:
1. **Input Signal**: Take an input signal (which may contain noise).
2. **Desired Signal**: Take a reference signal (the clean version of the signal).
3. **Error Calculation**: Compute the error between the filter's output and the desired signal.
4. **Weight Update**: Update the filter weights using the RMS of the error signal.

The filter is designed to minimize the Mean Square Error (MSE) over time.
